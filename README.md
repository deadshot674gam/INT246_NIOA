# Nature Inspired Optimisation Algorithms working with GUI


### How it works
1. Run app.py.
2. Press the algorithm button to enter the algorithm page.
3. Choose the function to be optimized. By default Rastrigin is selected.
4. Minimize value of function with algorithms graph will be printed.

__Note : this Program is still at it developing phase, so it may stop responding for a while__
