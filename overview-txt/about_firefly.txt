The firefly algorithm was developed by Xin-She Yang working in Cambridge in 2008 and published in Yang (2009). 
It adapted the behavior of firefly swarms to develop an algorithm for optimizing functions with multiple optima. 
In particular it used the concept of how the brightness of individual fireflies drew them together and a randomness 
factor to encourage exploration of the solution space.The publication of the firefly algorithm has led to many papers
being published on the analysis and modification of the algorithm and its application to many real world problems and
there have been many reports of its successful applications.
